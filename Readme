***********POLAR CODES************

“LDCP and Polar Codes in 5G Standard” 

Implementation of  the encoder for Polar Codes 

Implement the decoder: Successive Cancellation Decoder: SC decoder in Matlab

Simulation of Polar Codes and the simplified SC decoder 

Extend the code to be able to simulate the codec for Eb/N0 and BPSK over AWGN in the range from 1 to 4 dB in steps of 0,5 dB 

i)for an (64,32) code 

ii)for an (1024,512) code
